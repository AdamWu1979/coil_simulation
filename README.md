# coil_simulation
Matlab-based software to simulation B1 field for several geometries of coils.

First run planar_array.m
  - You will be asked to provide the number of elements and to define each one of them (size and position)
  - You will have to define the space where you what to do your filed calculation
  - The computed field will be save in a .mat file which contains B1,Bx,By,Bz componenets with the corresponding axis.
